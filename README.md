## ✅ Quality Assurance (Testing)

As a tester, the following were implemented:

- ✔️ Wrote **detailed test cases** for core features (login, cart, order, etc.)
- ✔️ Performed **manual testing** on Android devices
- ✔️ Tested APIs with Postman (login, get products, create order...)
- ✔️ Reported bugs in a structured format (steps to reproduce, expected vs actual)
- ✔️ Used SQL queries to verify backend data accuracy
- ✔️ Created a complete **test plan** (included in `/test_plan/`)
